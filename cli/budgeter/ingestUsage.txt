ingest reads transactions from a file into your budgeting database.

Usage: ingest <path>

Ingest currently only supports the CSV format. The file must end in .csv, and
its columns must be: Date, Entity, Amount, Note. This heading should not be
included

E.g. 1/9/1999, Falafel King, -5.99, Shawarma with friends!
