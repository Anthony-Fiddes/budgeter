limit allows you to set the max you'd like to spend in a given period.

e.g. "limit 100 week" will allow other budgeter commands to remind you of this
goal that you've set. 

Usage: limit <amount> <period>
    amount is the number of dollars you'd like to spend in a given period.

    period is the duration of time for which you're setting your goal. Allowed
    values are "day", "week", and "month".
